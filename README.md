A Python implementation of the classic Connect 4 game with an AI opponent using adversarial search and game-theoretic strategies. The AI plays optimally and can win (or draw) against a human player in the minimal number of moves when possible.

## 🚀 Features

- Classic Connect 4 gameplay (7 columns × 6 rows)  
- Human vs AI mode  
- AI powered by minimax / alpha-beta pruning  
- Simple graphical interface using **pygame**  
- Highlights winning moves  
- Easy-to-modify and extendable code structure
